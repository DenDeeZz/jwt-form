A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/lotap/pen/yNYxRz.

 I saw this login screen http://codepen.io/Lewitje/pen/BNNJjo and was inspired to make my own variation. I changed the "bubbles" to flow up through the whole window and instead of using a list, I used svg elements. I think this will allow for more flexibility, since an svg image could potentially be used instead of the rectangles.

I also changed the inputs to reflect some of the principles of Google's Material Design, even though I broke some rules. I saw how to create the inputs here: http://codepen.io/sevilayha/pen/IdGKH

Finally, for the submit button, I used an animation found here: http://codepen.io/chrisdothtml/pen/waKBdM This specifically goes against the Material Design Rules, but I like it anyway
